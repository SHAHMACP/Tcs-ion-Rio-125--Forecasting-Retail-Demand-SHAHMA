The objective is to build a forecasting system to predict the demand of a products at a retail outlet 
based on historical data by creating a forecast model, applying concepts of moving averages, forecasting 
methods, ARIMA models and time series forecasting. The model should be able to predict future sales 
by training on the historical sales data. 

The data set consists of saleâ€™s dates, product items, different stores and sales in a  time span from 2013 to 2017. The task of this paper is to accurately predict the sales data of 2018 based on the previous data. The characteristic of this case is that different products are distributed in different stores, and at the same time, the sales data has obvious seasonality. The data has significant discrete features.
